   <p>As a project for my Business Informations Systems and Technology class, I have been tasked with creating a website of myself.
I wanted to express myself and my interests to the visitors of my new website that I would like to update and one day use
frequently. </p>

<p> As a student I have learned that web development is very tricky. There are many different obstacles to face when
making a web page. Before coming to this school I thought websites were easy to make since you can just put in information
and it would automatically design it for yourself, although there is much more to it. I have done some html coding for
my Tumblr page although that was quite standard. </p>
