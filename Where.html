<p>This is my long back story from where I was from and how I came to be.</p>

<p>I am a student at University of Maine, and born in Estonia. I lived in Rockport Massachusetts for most of my life with my older brother Cevin.
    I also have three cats and one dog. My cat Ron is my most prized possession and friend.</p>
<p>What makes me life so different is that I wasn't born in America. I was born in a tiny little town called Viljandi Estonia.
    I had just recently went back to Estonia last summer, to see my other brothers and sisters who lived there. I also went back
    to learn the language again which I have forgotten since I've spent my entire life in America. My sisters Tiina and Kristi are my
    role models and heros. There is nothing that they can't overcome. My brother Kairo is also one of my favorite frineds because of
    how sweet and loving he is. The interesting part about my family is that I have tiny bits of traits from each sibling.
    I still can remember the day when my brother and I found my sisters online and it still makes me emotional from to this day and on.

    <p> The trip was a lot of fun because we got to do so much in two weeks that we've been there. It helped me remember my origins and
    who I really was in this big world. Another favorite part of the trip was spending time with my niece and nephew. The food was also really
    good. My favorite food is the Kalev chocolate, white chocolate with blueberries and tiny biscuit crumbs. Not only is the food amazing, but
    also the landscape as well. Estonia is referred to as "old town" since many old and historical buildings are still up and functional today.
    One of my favorite buildings was the leaning tower building. You could be standing on the sidewalk yet still look like the building is
    collapsing right in front of you. There is many great aspects of Estonia that I still remember, and even though it's such a small country,
    people should still visit it anyways.
